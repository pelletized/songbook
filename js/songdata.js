Flee to God's Kingdom!
(Zephaniah 2:3)

1. Oh, seek Jehovah, you meek ones and lowly; Seek what is right, and seek meekness today. Thus it may be in the day of his anger That you may be hidden away.
(CHORUS)

Flee to God's Kingdom, the hope of mankind; Firm for his rule take your stand. There you will find God's protection and blessing; Hasten to heed his command. 2. Come, you who hunger for truth and for justice; Why longer sorrow and cry out in pain? Seek now God's way to escape the oppressor, Submitting yourself to Christ's reign.
(Chorus)

3. Look up, yes, lift up your heads with rejoicing; See all the proof that the Kingdom is here! Welcome the light that Jehovah is sending, And let him alone be your fear!
(Chorus)

(See also Ps. 59:16; Prov. 18:10; 1 Cor. 16:13.)

17

Forward, You Witnesses!
(Luke 16:16)

1. Firm and determined in this time of the end, Prepared are God's servants the good news to defend. Though Satan against us has vaunted, In our God's strength we move ahead undaunted.
(CHORUS)

Then forward, you Witnesses, ever strong of heart! Rejoice that in God's work, you too may have a part! Go tell far and wide that the paradise is near And that soon all its blessings will be here. 2. Soldiers of Jah do not seek a life of ease; The world and its rulers we do not try to please. Unspotted at all times remaining, Our integrity we shall keep maintaining.
(Chorus)

3. God's Kingdom hope has been mocked and pushed aside; His great name is slandered, its holiness denied. Let's share in its sanctification, And proclaim it to ev'ry tribe and nation.
(Chorus)

(See also Phil. 1:7; 2 Tim. 2:3, 4; Jas. 1:27.)

18

God's Loyal Love
(Isaiah 55:1-3)

1. Loyal love! God is love. This truth cheers us from above. Love caused God to send his Son, Who for us the ransom won, That we might gain righteousness, Life eternal, happiness.
(CHORUS)

Hey there, all you thirsty ones, Come and drink life's water free. Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones; God's loving-kindness see. 2. Loyal love! God is love. All his works give proof thereof. Love for us he's further shown, Giving Christ the kingly throne To fulfill his cov'nant sworn. See! His Kingdom has been born.
(Chorus)

3. Loyal love! God is love. May his love move us to love. Loyally we'll help the meek, As God's righteous way they seek. May we preach with godly fear, Comfort spread for all to hear.
(Chorus)
(See also Ps. 33:5; 57:10; Eph. 1:7.)

God's Promise of Paradise
(Luke 23:43)

1. A paradise our God has promised, By means of Christ's Millennial Reign, When he'll blot out all sin and error, Removing death and tears and pain.
(CHORUS)

A paradise, the earth will be. With eyes of faith, this we can see. This promise Christ shall soon fulfill, For he delights to do God's will. 2. Soon here on earth, as God has purposed, His Son will cause the dead to rise. Thus it will be as Jesus promised: ‘You'll be with me in Paradise.'
(Chorus)

3. Yes, Paradise, our Lord did promise. And he is now earth's rightful King. We daily thank our loving Father, And from our hearts, his praises sing.
(Chorus)

(See also Matt. 5:5; 6:10; John 5:28, 29.)

Bless Our Meeting Together
(Hebrews 10:24, 25)

1. Bless us as we meet together, Great Jehovah, we now pray. For our meetings we do thank you; May your spirit with us stay. 2. Help us, Lord, refine our worship; With your Word, oh, do us fill. Train our minds and tongues to witness; Love within our hearts instill. 3. So, dear Father, bless our meetings; Grant us peace and unity. May our words and may our actions Magnify your Sov'reignty.

(See also Ps. 22:22; 34:3; Isa. 50:4.)

21

Happy, the Merciful!
(Matthew 5:7)

1. How happy are the merciful! In God's eyes they are beautiful. They tell to all who love the right That God in mercy takes delight. Through Jesus, mercy God displayed, Provision for our ransom made. He offers mercy to the meek Because he knows our frame is weak. 2. Those merciful like God are blessed; Through sins forgiven they have rest. They benefit by mercy shown, Since Christ appeared before God's throne. This mercy they would gladly share By preaching God's Word ev'rywhere, By telling men, "Be of good cheer Because the Kingdom now is here."

3. The meek will see Jehovah's love When they are judged by him above. His mercy they will really know, Since they, like him, true mercy show. So merciful let's strive to be And cultivate that quality. Our God and Christ have shown the way; May we show mercy ev'ry day.

(See also Luke 6:36; Rom. 12:8; Jas. 2:13.)

22

"Jehovah Is My Shepherd"
(Psalm 23)

1. Jehovah God is my Shepherd; So why should I fear or fret? For he who cares for his sheep so much Will none of his own forget. By quiet waters he leads me, My soul does restore and bless. He guides my steps for his own name's sake In pathways of righteousness. He guides my steps for his own name's sake In pathways of righteousness. 2. Alone in depths of deep shadow, I walk, yet I fear no harm. For my Great Shepherd is always near; His staff keeps me from alarm. My head with oil he refreshes; My cup he has filled up well. His loving-kindness will follow me, And there in his house I'll dwell. His loving-kindness will follow me, And there in his house I'll dwell.

3. How wise and loving my Shepherd! His praises with joy I sing. The cheering news of his tender care To sheeplike ones I will bring. His Word I'll faithfully follow, Walk carefully in his way. My glorious treasure of serving him, I'll gratefully use each day. My glorious treasure of serving him, I'll gratefully use each day.

(See also Ps. 28:9; 80:1.)

23

Jehovah, Our Strength
(Isaiah 12:2)

1. Gracious Jehovah, our strength and our might, You are our Savior, in you we delight. We are your Witnesses bearing your news, Whether men hear or they proudly refuse.
(CHORUS)

Jehovah, our Rock, our strength and our might, Your name we make known both day and night. Glorious Jehovah, Almighty in pow'r, You are our hiding place; You are our Tow'r. 2. We who now serve you rejoice in your light; With opened eyes, we now see truth and right. Searching the Scriptures, we hear your command; Making our choice, for your Kingdom we stand.
(Chorus)

3. Gladly, O God, we keep doing your will. Though Satan mocks us, we're trusting you still. Though he may slay us, oh, help us to be Firm to the end for your grand Sov'reignty.
(Chorus)

(See also 2 Sam. 22:3; Ps. 18:2; Isa. 43:12.)

Keep Your Eyes on the Prize!
(2 Corinthians 4:18)

1. When eyes of blind ones see again And ears of deaf ones hear again, When deserts blossom as the rose And from parched ground fresh water flows, When lame ones leap just like the hart, When loved ones never have to part, Such blessed times you'll realize, If you keep your eyes on the prize. 2. When tongues of mute ones speak again, When old ones will be young again, When earth will yield her rich increase And all good things will never cease, When songs of children fill the air, When joy and peace are ev'rywhere, Then, too, you'll see the dead arise, If you keep your eyes on the prize. 3. When wolves and lambs will feed as one, When bears and calves bask in the sun, A mere young boy will lead them all, And they will heed his childish call. When tears belong to yesterday, When fears and pain have passed away, You'll see how God these things supplies, If you keep your eyes on the prize.

(See also Isa. 11:6-9; 35:5-7; John 11:24.)

25

Proof of Discipleship
( John 13:34, 35)

1. There is a law we must all obey If we would live the Christian way. This is the kingly law from above; This is how we show Christlike love. Such was the love of our Lord, the Christ; His perfect life he sacrificed. He left a model we follow closely; His disciples, we prove to be. 2. Genuine love that will never fail Tenderly aids the weak or frail. Love is a debt that we must repay, Serving willingly day by day. No other place could we ever find Friends showing love of this rare kind. These are the bonds that we can be sure of; May we follow the way of love.

(See also Rom. 13:8; 1 Cor. 13:8; Jas. 2:8; 1 John 4:10, 11.)

26

Oh, Walk With God!
(Micah 6:8)

1. Oh, walk with God in modesty; Love kindness, and be true. With God keep your integrity; Let him your strength renew. If you would keep his truth so grand, By men be not beguiled; But let God lead you by the hand, Just as a little child. 2. Oh, walk with God in purity; Relapse not into sin. Advance to full maturity, And his approval win. And on whatever things are pure And lovely, true, and just, On these things think; and to endure, In God put all your trust. 3. Oh, walk with God in faithfulness, For then you will attain Contentment true and godliness, Which are the greatest gain. Oh, walk with God; be ever glad His glorious praise to sing. The greatest joy that can be had, His Kingdom work will bring.

(See also Gen. 5:24; 6:9; Phil. 4:8; 1 Tim. 6:6-8.)

27

Take Sides With Jehovah!
(Exodus 32:26)

1. Once with confusion our sad hearts were filled, Drinking the cup false religion distilled; But with what happiness our hearts were thrilled When of God's Kingdom we heard.
(CHORUS)

Take sides with Jehovah; Make him your delight. He'll never forsake you; Walk on in his light. Tell, tell the glad tidings Of freedom and peace. His rule by Christ Jesus Will ever increase. 2. Now we're rejoicing in serving our God, Spreading the seeds of his truth all abroad, Helping our brothers God's virtues to laud, Praising his great worthy name.
(Chorus)

3. We will not fear what the Devil can do. Trusting Jehovah will carry us through. Though they are many and though we are few, God is our strength and our might.
(Chorus)

(See also Ps. 94:14; Prov. 3:5, 6; Heb. 13:5.)

28

The New Song
(Psalm 98)

1. Sing to God a song, A song of praise that's bold and new. Tell of all the great things He's done and yet will do. Praise his mighty arm; He is the God of victory. In the cause of justice, He judges righteously.
(CHORUS)

Sing, sing, sing! The new song, let it ring! Sing, sing, sing! Jehovah is our King. 2. Make a joyful shout, A joyful cry to God, our King! Laud his name, give honor; A joyful anthem sing. Join the mighty throng, And sing aloud before the Lord. Harp and horn and trumpet Sound praise in full accord.
(Chorus)

3. Let the mighty sea And all therein resound with praise. Join with earth's creation, Exulting voices raise. Let the land rejoice, And let the rivers clap their hands. Mountains, hills, and valleys Sing praise in all the lands.
(Chorus)

(See also Ps. 96:1; 149:1; Isa. 42:10.)

29

Walking in Integrity
(Psalm 26)

1. Please, judge me, Lord, observe my loyalty; Observe my trust in you and my integrity. Examine me, and put me to the test; My mind and heart refine, that my soul might be blessed
(CHORUS)

But as for me, Determined I shall be to walk eternally In my integrity. 2. I do not sit with wicked men of lies. I hate the company of those who truth despise. With evil men, take not away my life; My soul, with those whose hands are full of bribes and strife.
(Chorus)

3. For I have loved the dwelling of your house. Your worship, oh, so pure, I daily will espouse. And I will march around your altar grand, To make thanksgiving heard aloud throughout the land.
(Chorus)

(See also Ps. 25:2.)

30

Jehovah Begins His Rule
(Revelation 11:15)

1. This is a glorious day. God's rule is now under way. He's laid in Zion his Chief Cornerstone. Let all now lift up the voice. Sing to our God, and rejoice. Christ, Lord and Savior, has been placed upon His throne.
(CHORUS)

What will you bring, Jehovah's Kingdom? Triumph of truth and righteousness. And bring what else, Jehovah's Kingdom? Eternal life and happiness. Praise the Universal Sov'reign For his love and faithfulness. 2. Christ now in power is here, And Armageddon is near. Satan's old system will soon pass away. Now is the season to preach. Many there are yet to reach; Time for the meek to take their stand for Him today.
(Chorus)

3. God's reigning Ruler we prize. Wondrous he is in our eyes. He comes in God's name; we bow to our King. Enter the grand temple gate; God's favor now supplicate. Soon dawns that day when he rules over ev'rything.
(Chorus)

(See also 2 Sam. 7:22; Dan. 2:44; Rev. 7:15.)
